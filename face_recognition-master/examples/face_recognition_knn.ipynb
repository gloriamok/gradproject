    "This is an example of using the k-nearest-neighbors (KNN) algorithm for face recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "When should I use this example?\n",
    "This example is useful when you wish to recognize a large set of known people,\n",
    "and make a prediction for an unknown person in a feasible computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm Description:\n",
    "The knn classifier is first trained on a set of labeled (known) faces and can then predict the person\n",
    "in an unknown image by finding the k most similar faces (images with closet face-features under euclidean distance)\n",
    "in its training set, and performing a majority vote (possibly weighted) on their label.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if k=3, and the three closest face images to the given image in the training set are one image of Biden\n",
    "and two images of Obama, The result would be 'Obama'.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This implementation uses a weighted vote, such that the votes of closer-neighbors are weighted more heavily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare a set of images of the known people you want to recognize. Organize the images in a single directory\n",
    "   with a sub-directory for each known person.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then, call the 'train' function with the appropriate parameters. Make sure to pass in the 'model_save_path' if you\n",
    "   want to save the model to disk so you can re-use the model without having to re-train it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Call 'predict' and pass in your trained model to recognize the people in an unknown image.\n",
    "\n",
